## Database migrations

Database migrations are handled via [Goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose).
Please install first if you don't
already have it.

```sh
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
```

Migration files are in sql/schema

## Database code

Code that interacts directly with our database is generated by [SQLC](https://sqlc.dev/).
Generated code won't be in the repo so if you want to use it you need to run

```sh
sqlc generate
```

## .env file

Before first start copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in the variables

## API documentation

The Documentation for the API can be found [in the doc folder](/docs/api.md)
